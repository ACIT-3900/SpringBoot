# CST Option SpringBoot Web Guide

The CST program will incorporate a web application to help automate and ease the process of assigning students into their preferred Options using Java Enterprise on top of the Spring Boot Baeldung framework. This project will help reduce the time and effort in the CST department when allocating students to Options. The final deliverable will be used by BCIT’s CST Faculty such as Program Head or Program Assistant. The project completion date is December 15, 2017.

6. Student not removed from list after user input name
	The spelling is case and letter sensitive, so it will need to be their exact name 
    
7. Student not added to list after user input name
There is a validation check that runs before user input their name where the system will only add names into the database if the student exists in the student list. (Case and letter sensitive)
